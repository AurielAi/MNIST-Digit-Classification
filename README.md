# MNIST-Digit-Classification

For this assignment, I will be working on the MNIST database. The MNIST data is a database of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The database contains 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of the 10 digits, along with a test set of 10,000 images. I have created an ANN model for identifying the digit from the handwritten images.
